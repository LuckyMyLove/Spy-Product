  - When you open main.exe, press 1 to add product from direct link of his site.
  Sample Link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/DARK_SOULS_III/
  - Confirm that you want to add this product to report.
  - ta-dah! See your product in report.xlsx file (in the same location as main.exe).

# Also:
  - You can refresh your report to view the latest data of your tracked products (option 2 in main.exe)
  - If you want to add couple products in the same time, just add thier link in the first column on the left

  - If you are no longer interested in track specific product, just delate his row from raport ;)
